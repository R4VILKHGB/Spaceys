Preliminary code attempt for sensor data collection based on the above example code.

#Code attempt for Pololu Gyro sensor connected to the first and second GPIO pins (I2C0 SDA) and (I2C0 SCL), respectively. 
i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(1), sda=Pin(0), freq=100)
i2c.scan()
i2c.writeto(76, b'123')  #Id like to look up the call sequence for these later for the significance of the 76 and the b'123'.
i2c.readfrom(76, 4)

#Code attempt for BMP 280 Pressure Sensor connected to the fourth and fifth GPIO pins (I2C1 SDA) and (I2C1 SCL), respectively.
i2c = I2C(1, scl=Pin(4), sda=Pin(3), freq=100)
i2c.scan()
i2c.writeto_mem(76, 6, b'456')
