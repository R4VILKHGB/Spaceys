High Altitude RF Transmission Project

## Milestone 1
### On Board Sensor Integration 
To aquire data from following sensors and save them on micro SD card  via Raspberry Pi. 
* Gyroscope integration
* Thermocouple integration
* Pressure sensor integration

### CAD Modelling
* Assembly model for polycarbonate box
* Bill of materials for structural parts
* mock up 3D models for electronics components within the assembly
* mock up model for dipole antennas incl. supporing parts
* insulation layers both inner and outer


## Milestone 2
### Risk Analysis
* Fill up form:  CSA-STRATOS-FORM-0010_rev_IR_-_SEB_PAYLAOD_QT
### Software Defined Radio
* setup HackRF to receive FM radio stations
* Setup radiating element in the lab by signal generator, receiving signal on HackRF
* get familiar with bandpass filters, attunuation, and other aspacts of SDR

## Milestone 3
## Transmitter RF Design and Development
* Signal generation - define equipment type specs
* RF amplifier - can handle output from signal generator and outputs 50 watts or higher transmission signal
* Antenna impedance matching with the internal electronics
* Design/Fabtication/Installation of the transmitter antenna module
* integrate into the box, mounting and assembling
* Testing for weather, impact, shock (mechanical)
* Testing for beam forms, attenuation, gain, signal strength and more (electronic)

## MileStone 4
## Receiver RF - Ground Station Design and Development
