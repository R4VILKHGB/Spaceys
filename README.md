High Altitude RF Transmission Project

## Milestone 1
### On Board Sensor Integration 
To aquire data from following sensors and save them on micro SD card  via Raspberry Pi. 
* Gyroscope integration
* Thermocouple integration
* Pressure sensor integration

### CAD Modelling
* Assembly model for polycarbonate box
* Bill of materials for structural parts
* mock up 3D models for electronics components within the assembly
* mock up model for dipole antennas incl. supporing parts
* insulation layers both inner and outer


## Milestone 2
### Risk Analysis
* Fill up form:  CSA-STRATOS-FORM-0010_rev_IR_-_SEB_PAYLAOD_QT
### Software Defined Radio
* setup HackRF to receive FM radio stations
* Setup radiating element in the lab by signal generator, receiving signal on HackRF
* get familiar with bandpass filters, attunuation, and other aspacts of SDR
### Payload Safety Control 
* integrate heating and cooling devices into the payload for temperature control
* add event driven temperature / pressure control software functions to activate heaters/coolers
* thermal analysis on transfer layers to optimize shielding electronics from extreme environment  

## Milestone 3
### Transmitter RF Design and Development
* Signal generation - define equipment type specs
* RF amplifier - can handle output power level from signal generator and outputs 50 watts or higher Tx power
* Antenna impedance matching with the internal electronics. (antenna tuning)
* Design/Fabtication/Installation of the transmitter antenna module (50 ohms internal impedance)
* integrate Tx antenna into payload box, mounting and assembling
* Testing for weather, impact, shock (mechanical testing)
* Testing for beam forms, attenuation, gain, signal strength and more (electronic testing)

## Milestone 4
### Receiver RF - Ground Station Design and Development
* Rx antenna design and development (mechanical structure, impedance matching, gain ...)
* Antenna to Hack RF integration
* Software development (noise filtering, analog to digital conversion, frequency domain analysis ...)
* Modularity (ease of transport, palican case storage)

## Milestone 5
### Mechanical Testing
### Electrical Testing
### Software Testing
### RF Signal Range Testing
